    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <div class="p_container">
      <p>I’m currently teaching myself Computer Science through the use of online courseware at places like <a href="https://home.edx.org/">edX</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. I first became interested in computer programming in the early 2000s. I wanted to become a game designer, and I had read that game programming was a valuable skill and entry point for people who wanted to enter that field.</p>
      <p>Naturally, I began by studying C++, which was considered one of the best languages for coding high-speed, modern games. Over time, however, I became less interested in a game design career and more in making games as a hobby. I shifted to programming in Python and, because it’s a more user-friendly language, I found it much better suited to the simple kinds of games I wanted to make.</p>
      <p>My crowning achievement was a simple point-and-click adaptation of the board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Masters"><em>Battle Masters</em></a> that I made using Pygame. You could only play the first two stages of the board game, you couldn’t save your progress, and it only had a 2-player mode (since opponent AI was beyond my abilities), but I was very pleased with my accomplishment!</p>
      <p>After that, I hung up my IDE and moved on to other hobbies. Programming was fun, but without high-speed Internet and the ability to check search engines and watch YouTube videos at any time of day (without tying up the phone line for everyone else in the house), it was very difficult for me to locate help and learning resources online.</p>
      <p>Flash forward to 2023. GPT-4 was released to the public, and I saw videos on YouTube showing how you could ask it to help you write code and it would do a surprisingly good job at it. I enjoyed computer programming and I always felt like I could do more with it if I had the right tools. It became clear to me that a chatbot could be one of those tools.</p>

    <h2>First Steps</h2>
    <div class="p_container">
      <p>I started off by asking <a href="https://bing.com/chat">Bing Chat</a> to make me a program in Python that would add a record of the current date and time to a .txt file whenever I ran the program. It worked! Then I asked it to make adjustments (e.g. using a different format for the date), and to explain the pieces of code that I wasn’t able to understand. It performed both of these tasks admirably.</p>
      <p>That first coding session left a lasting impression on me. It was obvious that, with Bing Chat’s tutelage and assistance, plus the many other resources (YouTube, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>, etc.) that were now available to me, my dream of becoming a computer programmer was now within reach!</p>
